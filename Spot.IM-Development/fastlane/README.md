The setup_circle_ci fastlane action will perform the following actions:
  Create a new temporary keychain for use with match (see the CircleCI code signing doc for more details).
  Switch match to readonly mode to make sure CI does not create new code signing certificates or provisioning profiles.
  Set up log and test result paths to be easily collectible.
